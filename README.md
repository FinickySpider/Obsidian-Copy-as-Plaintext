## What It Does

- Adds a “Copy as Plain-Text” command to:
  - The editor’s right-click context menu  
  - The Command Palette    
- Offers two stripping modes:
    1. Super Simple (regex-based) — strips common markers like
    `#`, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `[links](url)`, `![images](url)` 
    2. Unified/Remark (AST-based) — full GFM support (tables, task lists, footnotes, math, frontmatter, HTML blocks)  
- Fine-tunable settings let you enable/disable:
  - GFM tables & task lists  
  - YAML frontmatter  
  - Inline and block math  
  - Footnotes & inline refs  
  - Highlight markers (==text==)  
  - Custom markers ([~], [>])  
  - List numbers (1., 2., …)  
  - Dashes wrapping words (---word---)  
  - Hashtags (#tag) and mentions (@user)  
  - LaTeX commands (\quad, \int, etc.)

## Known Issues & Quirks

- **Performance:** AST-based stripping can be slower on very large selections—use Super Simple mode for speed.  
- Edge-case syntax: Some niche Markdown plugins or custom syntax may not be recognized by the AST pipeline.  
- Backslash escapes: By default, backslash-escaped characters (e.g. \*, \[ ) are unescaped; toggle settings if you need to preserve literal backslashes.  
- Table layout: The AST pipeline removes table structure; if you need plain rows or pipes, consider disabling table stripping in settings.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why don’t my settings seem to do anything?  
**A:** Make sure **Simple Mode** is turned *off* in the plugin settings, otherwise, advanced options are ignored for speed.

**Q:** Can I copy images as plain text?  
**A:** Yes. Markdown image links are stripped down to the alt/title text.

**Q:** Does it handle custom Markdown plugins?  
**A:** The AST-based mode covers most standard Markdown. Some third-party plugin syntax might not be recognized.

**Q:** What’s the difference between Simple Mode and Unified/Remark?  
**A:** Simple Mode is a fast, lightweight text-only method that strips Markdown using simple rules (think regex). It’s quick and works well for basic notes, but can make mistakes with complex formatting (code blocks, nested styling, HTML, tables, etc.). Unified/Remark parses the Markdown properly and removes formatting reliably. It’s slower, but the results are more accurate.
